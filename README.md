# get_next_line
My third project in ["school 42"](https://42.fr/en/homepage/).

The 42 school's get_next_line project is where we learn to read from a file descriptor, as well as the use of static variables.

This function returns a single line from a given file descriptor. If called in a loop, get_next_line returns the entire contents of a file, line by line until it reaches the end of the file. It can be compiled specifying any buffer size.
